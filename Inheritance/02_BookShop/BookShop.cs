//You are working in a library. And you are pissed of writing descriptions for books by hand, so you wanted to use the computer to make them faster. So the task is 
//simple. Your program should have two classes – one for the ordinary books – Book, and another for the special ones – GoldenEditionBook. So let’s get started! 
//We need two classes:
//•	Book - represents a book that holds title, author and price.A book should offer information about itself in the format shown in the output below.
//•	GoldenEditionBook - represents a special book holds the same properties as any Book, but its price is always 30% higher
